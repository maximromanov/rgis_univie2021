Generate the results into HTML or PDF (PDF is a little bit trickier). Submit your homework as described below. 1.9 Common issues with homework 1.9.1 Tracing errors Errors happen all the time. You will run into errors when you run your code. You will run into error messages when “knitting” your document — as a result, your document will not be generated. To resolve this: It is important to run each chunk of code separately to ensure that they all work. If any of the chunks throw errors, you will not be able to “knit” your documents. When you run into an error, R Markdown panel (usually in the lower left corner of RStudio interface) will tell you in which line the error occurred. You will need to fix it the same way you would in Step 1. 1.9.2 Comments / “Commenting out” You do not want to constantly keep [re]installing libraries. So, if a library is already installed, you can “comment out” that line. For example, the code chunk above should become: #install.packages(&quot;historydata&quot;) #install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Adding # in front of a line (or a section of a line) turns it into a comment and it will not longer be executed. 1.9.3 Random errors Think about the following two lines of code.

Creating one’s own dataset Digitizing data from printed and/or hand-written sources 5.6 Main format Relational databases or Tables/Spreadsheets (tabular data)? Tabular format: tables; spreadsheets; CSV/TSV files. Unique identifiers: tables with different data can be connected via unique identifiers Note: A relational database (rDB) is a collection of interconnected tables. Tables in an rDB are connected with each other via unique identifiers which are usually automatically created by the database itself when new data is added. One can maintain interconnected tables without creating a rDB: Open Linked Data Example: Table of the growth of cities. One table includes information on population over time; Another table includes coordinates of the cities from the dataset. It is more efficient and practical (reducing error rate from typos) to work on these tables separately, and connect them via unique identifiers of cities which are used in both tables. 5.6.1 Note on the CSV/TSV format CSV stands for comma-separated values; TSV — for tab-separated values. Below is an examples of a CSV format. Here, the first line is the header, which provides the names of columns; each line is a row, while columns are separated with , commas. city,growth_from_2000_to_2013,latitude,longitude,population,rank,state New York,4.8%,40.7127837,-74.0059413,8405837,1,New York Los Angeles,4.8%,34.0522342,-118.2436849,3884307,2,California Chicago,-6.1%,41.8781136,-87.6297982,2718782,3,Illinois Houston,11.0%,29.7604267,-95.3698028,2195914,4,Texas Philadelphia,2.6%,39.9525839,-75.1652215,1553165,5,Pennsylvania TSV is a better option than a CSV, since TAB characters (\\t) are very unlikely to appear in values. Neither TSV not CSV are good for preserving new line characters (\\n)—or, in other words, text split into multiple lines/paragraphs. As a workaround, one can convert \\n into some unlikely-to-occur character combination (for example, ;;;), which would be easy to restore into \\n later, if necessary. 5.7 Basic principles of organizing data: Tidy Data 5.7.1 Tidy Data Each variable is in its own column Each observation is in its own row Each value is in its own cell 5.7.2 Clean Data Column names and row names are easy to use and informative. In general, it is a good practice to avoid spaces and special characters. Good example: western_cities Alternative good example: WesternCities Bad example: Western Cities (only the largest) Obvious mistakes in the data have been removed Date format: YYYY-MM-DD is the most reliable format. Any thoughts why? There should be no empty cells: If you have them, it might be that your data is not organized properly. If your data is organized properly, NA must be used as an explicit indication that data point is not available. Each cell must contain only one piece of data. Variable values must be internally consistent Be consistent in coding your values: M and man are different values computationally, but may be the same in the dataset; Keep track of your categories: a document where all codes used in the data set are explained. Preserve original values If you are working with a historical dataset, it might be inconsistent. For example, distances between cities are given in different formats: days of travel, miles, farsaḫs/parasangs, etc.). Instead of replacing original values, it is better to create an additional column, where this information will be homogenized according to some principle. Keeping original data will allow to homogenize data in multiple ways. Clearly differentiate between the original and modified/modelled values. The use of suffixes can be convenient: Distance_Orig vs Distance_Modified. Most of editing operations should be performed in software other than R; any spreadsheet program will work, unless it cannot export into CSV/TSV format. Keep in mind that if you prepare your data in an Excel-like program, rich formatting (like manual highlights, bolds, and italics) is not data and it will be lost, when you export your data into CSV/TSV format. Note: It might be useful, however, to use rule-based highlighting in order, for example, to identify bad values that need to be fixed. Back up your data! http://github.com is a great place for this, plus it allows to work collaboratively as well as to keep track of all changes. Google spreadsheets is a decent alternative for collaborative work, but it lacks version control and detailed tracking of changes. 5.8 In Class II: Practical To update: add the Viennese dataset for homework: data must be collected and organized according to the principles of tidy data this is a collaborative assignment 5.9 Morris Dataset: the East Vs. the West War-making capacity since 4000 BCE (in social development points).

One of the most common way of modeling data in historical research—joining items into broader categories. Categorization is important because it allows to group items with low frequencies into items with higher frequencies, and through those discern patterns and trends. Additionally, alternative categorizations allow one to test different perspectives on historical data. The overall process is rather simple in terms of technological implementation, but is quite complex in terms of subject knowledge and specialized expertise is required to make well-informed decisions. For example, let’s say we have the following categories: baker, blacksmith, coppersmith, confectioner, and goldsmith. These can be categorized as occupations; Additionally, blacksmith, coppersmith, and goldsmith can also be categorized as ‘metal industry’, while baker and confectioner, can be categorized as ‘food industry’; Yet even more, one might want to introduce additional categories, such as luxury production to include items like goldsmith and confectioner; and regular production for items like baker, blacksmith, coppersmith. Such categorizations can be created in two different ways, with each having its advantages: first, one can create them as additional columns. This approach will allow to always have the original—or alternative—classifications at hand, which is helpful for re-thinking classifications and creating alternative ones where items will be reclassified differently, based on a different set of assumptions about your subject. second, these can be created in separate files, which might be easier as one does not have to stare at existing classifications and therefore will be less influenced by them in making classification decisions. Additionally, one can use some pre-existing classifications that have already been created in academic literature. These most likely need to be digitized and converted into properly formatted data, as we discussed in the previous lesson. 6.6 Normalization This is a rather simple, yet important procedure, which is, on the technical side, very similar to what was described above. In essence, the main goal of normalization is to remove insignificant differences that may hinder analysis. Most common examples would be: bringing information to the same format (e.g., dates, names, etc.) unifying spelling differences It is a safe practice to preserve the initial data, creating normalized data in separate columns (or tables) 6.7 Note: Proxies, Features, Abstractions These are the terms that refer to the same idea. The notion of proxies is used in data visualization, that of features—in computer science; that of abstractions—in the humanities. The main idea behind these terms is that some simple features of an object can act as proxies to some complex phenomena. For example, Ian Morris uses the size of cities as a proxy to the complexity of social organization. The logic is following: the larger the size of a city, the more complex social, economic and technical organization is required to keep that city functional, therefore is can be used as an indicator of the social complexity. While proxies are selected from what is available—usually not much, especially when it comes to historical data—as a way to approach something more complex, it may be argued that abstractions are often arrived to from the opposite direction. We start with an object which is available in its complexity and we reduce its complexity to a more manageable form which—we expect—would prepresent a particular aspect of the initial complex object. Most commonly this is applied to texts in a natural language. For example, in stylometry texts are reduced to freqiency lists of most frequent features, which are expected to represent an authorial fingerprint. The complexity of texts can be reduced in a number of ways: into a list of lemmas (e.g., for topic modeling analysis), frequency lists (e.g., for document distance comparison), syntactic structures, ngrams, etc. This list is never set and researchers can create multiple abstractions depending on their research questions. 6.8 In Class II: Practical Data for the practical session and homework: Bosker_Data.zip.

To begin with, creating maps became so much easier now. Yet, more importantly, we can now map our data to understand spatial distribution of different phenomena — and how this distribution changed over time; we can map data representing different phenomena and study how they may have affected each other; we can map connections and study how physical space affects the formation of networks; and so much more. This course will focus on the use of the programming language R which shines when it comes to data analysis and creating robust visualizations. The course will consist of three main parts. Part I will introduce you to the basics of R and its philosophy of “tidy data.” Part II will focus on specific methods and techniques of spatial analysis. Part III will require you to focus on your own research projects. The language of the course is English. Assessment and permitted materials Assessment will be based on class participation, homework assignments, and a final project (final projects can be prepared either individually or in groups; ideally, your final project should be directly connected to research projects that you carry out for other courses or for your BA, MA, or PhD theses). Minimum requirements and assessment criteria No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial. Course Evaluation Course evaluation will be a combination of in-class participation (30%), weekly homework assignments (50%), and the final project (20%). Class Participation Attendance is required; regular participation is the key to completing the course; all students must come with their laptops; homework assignments must be submitted on time (some can be completed later as a part of the final project, but this must be discussed with the instructor whenever the issue arises); the final project must be submitted on time. Homework Assignments Homework assignments are due before the beginning of the following class; You will need to complete your worksheet and generate HTML or PDF document with the results, which you then submit to the instructor as attachments via email; In the subject of your email, please, use the following format: CourseID-LessonID-HW-Lastname-matriculationNumber, for example, if I were to submit homework for the first lesson, my subject header would look like: 070184-L01-HW-Romanov-12435687. DH is a collaborative field, so you are most welcome to work on your homework assignments in groups, however: you must still submit it. That is, if a groups of three works on one assignment, there must be three separate submissions emailed from each member’s email. Reading-Reporting Assignments: one of your tasks will be to identify relevant readings (articles, book sections), read them, and provide short summaries (250-500 words) in the shared Zotero library for our course. You need to submit 5 such short summaries for full credit. “Relevant” means that these readings must be relevant to your own research interests. Ideally, you will use these readings as an additional background for your final projects. Some readings will be suggested, but I would encourage you to invest some time into this task and find your own readings (which is now very easy with such available resources as JSTOR). NB: For most classes you will need to complete and submite worksheets. Some questions in those worksheets will be easy, but some you might find to be difficult and even impossible. We will go over the difficult parts of each worksheet in class, so do not worry. The main goal is to practice, since for most students this course will be very new and very strange. In practical terms this means that you need to to submit your worksheet in time with your best try for each question. The worksheets will be graded by completion, i.e. you will get full credit if you: 1) complete all the easy and moderately difficult questions; 2) give an honest try to the very difficult questions; 3) ask for help in class and/or office hours to make sure that you understand the challenges. Final Project The final project is your own research project that uses collections of texts of your interest and research methods introduced inthe course. You are encouraged to explore methods outside of those covered within the course. Ideally, your research project should be directly related to your main research project that you undertake in your studies. You are welcome to work in groups on your final projects, but make sure to discuss that with the instructor first.

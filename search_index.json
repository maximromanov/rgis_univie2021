Unzip it and open in RStudio. Let’s work through it!

Mullen, Computational Historical Thinking: With Applications in R (2018–): https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com. Use the this primer as a quick introduction to the R language, or as a reference for the rest of the course. The original worksheets have been developed by Lincoln Mullen (https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/worksheets.html). The ones used in this class might have undergone some changes and relevant adaptations. Your R installation may ‘speak’ your main language. It is nice on one hand, but can be quite inconvenient in class, where the main language is English. You may have to do cast some spells to switch R into English. Possible solutions can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575180/how-to-change-language-settings-in-r/ 1.7 Homework: Complete the worksheet Getting familiar with R. Generate the results into HTML or PDF (PDF is a little bit trickier). Submit your homework as described below. 1.8 Common issues with homework: 1.9 Tracing errors Errors happen all the time. You will run into errors when you run your code. You will run into error messages when “knitting” your document — as a result, your document will not be generated. To resolve this: It is important to run each chunk of code separately to ensure that they all work. If any of the chunks throw errors, you will not be able to “knit” your documents. When you run into an error, R Markdown panel (usually in the lower left corner of RStudio interface) will tell you in which line the error occurred. You will need to fix it the same way you would in Step 1. 1.10 Comments / Commenting out You do not want to constantly keep [re]installing libraries. So, if a library is already installed, you can “comment out” that line. For example, the code chunk above should become: #install.packages(&quot;historydata&quot;) #install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Adding # in front of a line (or a section of a line) turns it into a comment and it will not longer be executed. 1.11 Random errors: Think about the following two lines of code. Any issues that you can explain? (You might want to run these lines in R to get some clues) `?median` variable1 &lt;- DigitalHumanities 1.12 Submitting homework: Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class; Email your homework to the instructor as attachments. In the subject of your email, please, add the following: 070184-LXX-HW-YourLastName-YourMatriculationNumber, where LXX is the numnber of the lesson for which you submit homework; YourLastName is your last name; and YourMatriculationNumber is your matriculation number.

To begin with, creating maps became so much easier now. Yet, more importantly, we can now map our data to understand spatial distribution of different phenomena — and how this distribution changed over time; we can map data representing different phenomena and study how they may have affected each other; we can map connections and study how physical space affects the formation of networks; and so much more. This course will focus on the use of the programming language R which shines when it comes to data analysis and creating robust visualizations. The course will consist of three main parts. Part I will introduce you to the basics of R and its philosophy of “tidy data.” Part II will focus on specific methods and techniques of spatial analysis. Part III will require you to focus on your own research projects. The language of the course is English. Assessment and permitted materials Assessment will be based on class participation, homework assignments, and a final project (final projects can be prepared either individually or in groups; ideally, your final project should be directly connected to research projects that you carry out for other courses or for your BA, MA, or PhD theses). Minimum requirements and assessment criteria No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial. Course Evaluation Course evaluation will be a combination of in-class participation (30%), weekly homework assignments (50%), and the final project (20%). Class Participation Attendance is required; regular participation is the key to completing the course; all students must come with their laptops; homework assignments must be submitted on time (some can be completed later as a part of the final project, but this must be discussed with the instructor whenever the issue arises); the final project must be submitted on time. Homework Assignments Homework assignments are due before the beginning of the following class; You will need to complete your worksheet and generate HTML or PDF document with the results, which you then submit to the instructor as attachments via email; In the subject of your email, please, use the following format: CourseID-LessonID-HW-Lastname-matriculationNumber, for example, if I were to submit homework for the first lesson, my subject header would look like: 070184-L01-HW-Romanov-12435687. DH is a collaborative field, so you are most welcome to work on your homework assignments in groups, however: you must still submit it. That is, if a groups of three works on one assignment, there must be three separate submissions emailed from each member’s email. Reading-Reporting Assignments: one of your tasks will be to identify relevant readings (articles, book sections), read them, and provide short summaries (250-500 words) in the shared Zotero library for our course. You need to submit 5 such short summaries for full credit. “Relevant” means that these readings must be relevant to your own research interests. Ideally, you will use these readings as an additional background for your final projects. Some readings will be suggested, but I would encourage you to invest some time into this task and find your own readings (which is now very easy with such available resources as JSTOR). NB: For most classes you will need to complete and submite worksheets. Some questions in those worksheets will be easy, but some you might find to be difficult and even impossible. We will go over the difficult parts of each worksheet in class, so do not worry. The main goal is to practice, since for most students this course will be very new and very strange. In practical terms this means that you need to to submit your worksheet in time with your best try for each question. The worksheets will be graded by completion, i.e. you will get full credit if you: 1) complete all the easy and moderately difficult questions; 2) give an honest try to the very difficult questions; 3) ask for help in class and/or office hours to make sure that you understand the challenges. Final Project The final project is your own research project that uses collections of texts of your interest and research methods introduced inthe course. You are encouraged to explore methods outside of those covered within the course. Ideally, your research project should be directly related to your main research project that you undertake in your studies. You are welcome to work in groups on your final projects, but make sure to discuss that with the instructor first.
